## How to Run the Website

1. Navigate to the `front end` folder in your project directory.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
3. Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
4. The website should load, displaying the front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality.

Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., double-click the file or right-click and select "Open with" your preferred browser).

## Project Structure

- `front end/index.html`: Main HTML file
- `front end/css/style.css`: Stylesheet for the website
- `front end/js/script.js`: JavaScript for interactivity
